#Vim
------------
This is my personal configuration of vim. If github had
unlisted repos this would be one.

My vim config has full LSP and buffer tabs along with 
FZF intergration, also I've written a custom use of 
my file editor of choice yazi which can be used through
the \ef bind, if you select multiple files in yazi then
a vsplit will open for each file!

This config is mainly for my use so do not expect me to
cater to any issues that are made.

Some screenshots are in the ./img folder, the font used
in the screenshots is:
Terminus (TTF)
-------------

# Basic installation
simply run `:PlugInstall` when running for the first time.
if FZF fails to install then you will have to manually go 
and install it to your system. yazi needs to be installed. 
If you go to Yazi's quickstart page you'll find an alias
function to put in your shell config file. In this case 
the alias is simply called 'y' so this also needs to be 
set of course this can be changed through the vimrc config
file.

If you are interested in my configuration for my window 
manager of choice DWM, please navigate to my dwm repo:

Thank you.
